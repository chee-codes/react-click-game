# react-click-game

## Description

Click Game is a memory game, built using React. Users begin the game by clicking on one of the pictures on screen. For the initial click and every correct click, a score is tallied, and the pictures are shuffled and re-rendered to the page awaiting another click. If the user clicks a picture more than once in the game, the game is over and the top score is shown at the top.
